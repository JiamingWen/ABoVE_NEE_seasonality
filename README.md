# ABoVE_NEE_seasonality

## Overview

This repository contains code for analyzing the seasonality of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) in the ABoVE (Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment) study area. We evaluated NEE estimates derived from three distinct approaches: atmospheric inversions, upscaled flux measurements, and terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), using atmospheric CO2 observations collected during airborne campaigns organized as part of the Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) and the Arctic Carbon Atmospheric Profiles (Arctic-CAP) campaigns during 2012-2014 and 2017, respectively.
